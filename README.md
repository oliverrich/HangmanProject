# HangmanProject
For my first project of cis 25, I decided to make a game of hangman because I thought that it was one of my favorite childhood games. I also loved to play it during 
class with my friends. I believe that I fully implemented all of the parts that were required for the project.

I decided to add a mode that allows the user to either use a random assortment of words that I chose or, allow the user (or their friend) to pick the word.
I also added, per guidance of my instructor, a harder difficult in which the user has fewer guesses.

The UI is elegant and shows all the pertenant information, like guesses left, which letters the user already guessed, and most importantly, the progress of the word being drawn such as how it is hand-drawn in real life.

We can see the user winning a game with the hidden word being "Burrito"
